Websci Lab 2
Author: Lou Yufan

This lab is a practise on using weather API and a weather widget frontend.

Due to time management issue I was only able to finish the basic functions and a basic interface.

I attempted to add a drop down menu to let the user choose from several nearby cities. Due to unfamiliarity to the technology, I do not have time to complete the idea.
