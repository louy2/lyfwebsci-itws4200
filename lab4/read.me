Lab 4 Readme
Lou Yufan

In lab 4 I was stuck in the authentication of twitter. I used jQuery ajax and then a php SDK with no success to pass twitter's OAuth mechanism.

On the front-end side, I took the layout in lab 1 and made the grid fluid to have it responsive. I tried to add media queries to hide hashtags when too narrow but they didn't work as I expected.
